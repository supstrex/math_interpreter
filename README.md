This is a simple interpretator of Mathematical expressions. It supports basic operations such "+", "-", "/", "*", "%", "^" as well as more complex calculations such "sin", "cos", "tan" etc. It allows to use identifiers to hold results of expressions and further operate on them. Use whitespace to mark the end of each expression.
